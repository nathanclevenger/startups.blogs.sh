# 5 Metrics to Measure Success in Growth Hacking

Growth hacking has become one of the most popular topics in the tech industry. It is a unique approach to marketing, where you use creativity, data, and experimentation to rapidly grow your business or brand. Growth hacking is different from traditional marketing techniques because it focuses on measurable, scalable, and repeatable strategies that can help you achieve sustainable growth.

However, growth hacking is not easy, especially if you don't know where to start. The success of your growth hacking strategy depends on creating a measurable system that allows you to track your progress and adjust your tactics quickly. In this post, we will explore the 5 metrics that you can use to measure success in growth hacking.

## 1. Acquisition

Acquisition is the first metric to track because it measures the number of new users or customers who discovered your brand through various channels. Acquisition answers the question, "How many people are finding out about our brand, and how are they finding us?"

The best way to measure acquisition is to use Google Analytics. You can track your acquisition by using the "Traffic Sources" feature, which tells you the sources of your website traffic.

To improve your acquisition rate, you need to experiment with your marketing channels. Some of the most popular channels are social media, email marketing, SEO, paid advertising, and content marketing. You can try different tactics in each channel to see what works best for your brand.

## 2. Activation

Activation is the second metric to track because it shows you how many of your users or customers have completed a specific action that brings them closer to your business goal. Activation answers the question, "How many people are taking the action that we want them to take?"

The best way to measure activation is to identify the key action that you want your users or customers to take and track it. It could be anything from signing up for a newsletter to making a purchase. You can use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or any other analytics software to track this metric.

To improve activation, you need to make sure that you are providing value to your users or customers. Your product or service should solve their problem, and the user experience should be seamless. Also, you need to make your call-to-action prominent and clear so that users know what they need to do next.

## 3. Retention

Retention is the third metric to track because it measures how many of your users or customers are returning to your site or app after their initial visit. Retention answers the question, "How many people are coming back to our site, and how often are they coming back?"

The best way to measure retention is to track your user retention rate. A good retention rate depends on your industry, but in general, you should aim for a retention rate of 30-40% after the first month.

To improve retention, you need to create a great user experience that keeps your users engaged with your brand. You can use email marketing, notifications, or other methods to keep your users coming back. Additionally, you need to listen to feedback and iterate on your product or service to make it better.

## 4. Referral

Referral is the fourth metric to track because it measures the number of users or customers who are referring your brand to their friends or family. Referral answers the question, "How many people are spreading the word about our brand?"

The best way to measure referral is to use a referral tracking tool like ReferralCandy or Viral Loops. You can create a referral program that incentivizes your users or customers to refer their friends, and then track the referral rate.

To improve referral, you need to create a great product or service that your users love and want to share with others. Additionally, you need to make your referral program easy to use and provide great incentives for your users to refer their friends.

## 5. Revenue

Revenue is the final metric to track because it measures how much money your business is generating. Revenue answers the question, "How much money are we making from our growth hacking efforts?"

The best way to measure revenue is to use your accounting software or payment processor. You can track the revenue generated from each customer or product.

To improve revenue, you need to experiment with pricing, upsells, and cross-sells. You can also focus on increasing the lifetime value of your customers by providing great customer service, loyalty programs, and other value-adds.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, growth hacking is an effective approach to marketing that can help your business achieve scalable and repeatable growth. To succeed in growth hacking, you need to create a measurable system that allows you to track your progress and adjust your tactics quickly. The 5 metrics that we covered are acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue. By tracking these metrics, you can optimize your growth hacking strategy and achieve sustainable growth for your business.
