# How to Turn Your Customers into Your Best Growth Hackers

As a business owner, you know the importance of growth to the success of your business. But did you know that your customers can be an incredible source of growth for your business? That's right! By turning your satisfied customers into advocates, you can use their influence to drive more business and accelerate growth. In this post, we'll explore how you can turn your customers into your best growth hackers.

## What is a growth hacker?

Before we dive into how to turn your customers into growth hackers, let's first define what a growth hacker is. A growth hacker is someone who focuses on growth via unconventional marketing tactics. Growth hackers are creative, data-driven, and agile in their approach. They are always looking for ways to increase user acquisition, user retention, and revenue.

## Why turn your customers into growth hackers

Your customers are one of the most essential assets of your business. You spend time, money, and resources to acquire them. Therefore, it makes sense to leverage them as much as possible for growth. Here are some of the reasons why you should turn your customers into your best growth hackers:

- They are more trustworthy: A recent study by McKinsey & Company found that customers are more likely to trust recommendations from friends and family members than traditional forms of advertising. As a result, when customers refer your business to their network, it's a vote of confidence and social proof to their network.
- Cost-effective: The cost of acquiring new customers can be high. When you harness the power of your customers, you can get new customers at a much lower cost. This cost savings can then be allocated towards other business areas like product development or improving your customer experience.
- Increased conversion rates: Leads generated through customer referrals tend to have higher conversion rates than other types of leads.

## How to turn customers into growth hackers

Now that you understand the benefits of turning customers into growth hackers, let's explore how to do it. Here are four actionable steps to help you turn your happy customers into advocates:

### Step 1: Provide an excellent customer experience

The foundation of customer advocacy is providing an excellent customer experience. When customers have a positive experience, they are more likely to recommend your business to their network. Therefore, focus on delivering value to your customers at every stage of the customer journey. From the initial contact to follow-up support, make sure their experience with your business is positive.

### Step 2: Ask for feedback and reviews

An effective way to boost customer advocacy is by asking for feedback and reviews. Not only does this help you improve your products or services, but it also creates a sense of loyalty from customers. Make sure to follow up with customers who leave feedback and reviews to thank them for their time.

### Step 3: Create customer referral programs

Customer referral programs are an effective way to incentivize customers to refer your business to their network. The program can offer rewards like discounts, free products, or gift cards. These incentives will encourage customers to refer their friends and family members to your business, ultimately leading to more growth for your business.

### Step 4: Engage with your customers

Engaging with your customers is critical to building a relationship with them. Communicate with your customers through email, social media, or chat to show that you value their support. Ask for feedback, provide customer support, and offer exclusive content to keep them engaged.

## Examples of companies that have successfully turned customers into growth hackers

Many companies have successfully turned their customers into growth hackers. Here are two examples:

### Dropbox

Dropbox is a cloud storage company that offers file-sharing services to businesses and individuals. To drive growth, Dropbox created a referral program that offers users thirty days of free premium service for every friend who signs up using their referral link. This incentive led to a rapid increase in user acquisition, making it one of the most successful referral programs in history.

### Airbnb

Airbnb is a platform that connects travelers with local hosts for lodging. In 2011, Airbnb conducted a growth hack by creating Craigslist ads that linked to the Airbnb platform. This hack increased the company's user base and put it on a path to becoming the leading player in the hospitality industry.

## Conclusion

Turning your customers into your best growth hackers is an effective way to accelerate the growth of your business. The steps outlined in this post provide a framework for leveraging the power of customer advocates. Remember to focus on providing an excellent customer experience, asking for feedback and reviews, creating customer referral programs, and engaging with your customers.
