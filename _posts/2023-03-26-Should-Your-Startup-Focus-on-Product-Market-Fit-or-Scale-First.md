# Should Your Startup Focus on Product Market Fit or Scale First?

As a startup, it can be tempting to focus on growth and scale right out of the gate. After all, who doesn’t want to be the next unicorn in their industry? However, many experts argue that before you can focus on growth and scale, you need to establish solid product-market fit. So which one should your startup focus on first – product-market fit or scale?

## The Importance of Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit is the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market need. Simply put, it’s about creating a product that people want and need. Without product-market fit, your startup won’t succeed in the long term, no matter how much you try to scale. 

Some benefits of achieving product-market fit include:

- A deeper understanding of your target market
- Higher customer retention rates
- More meaningful feedback from customers
- Increased credibility with investors

To put it simply, product-market fit is the essential foundation of any successful business. Without it, trying to scale your startup can be like trying to build a house on a shaky foundation. 

## The Case for Focusing on Scale First

On the other hand, some entrepreneurs argue that focusing on scale first is the best approach. When companies focus on scale instead of product-market fit, they do so with the hope that the market will evolve to adopt their product. For some successful companies, this approach works. Scaling quickly can help a startup establish itself as a dominant player in their industry before competitors catch on. However, this approach is not without risks.

Focusing on scale first comes with potential pitfalls, including:

- Overvaluing short-term gains over long-term success
- Making decisions based on metrics like revenue and customers rather than product-market fit
- Sacrificing customer satisfaction in the name of growth
- Less compelling investor pitches due to lack of understanding of the target market

While it’s important to scale quickly in certain situations, doing so without a strong product-market fit can come at a considerable cost.

## Finding the Right Balance

So which one should your startup focus on first – product-market fit, or scale? The answer, like many things in the startup world, is complicated. The optimal approach for your company will depend on several factors, including:

- Industry: Some industries, like software, are more conducive to focusing on scale first than others.
- Business model: Certain business models, like the subscription model, require stronger product-market fit before scaling.
- Market maturity: In a more mature market, focusing on product-market fit may be less critical than in a less mature market.

The key lies in finding the right balance between the two. While focusing exclusively on product-market fit can leave your startup stagnating, scaling too quickly can be counterproductive. Startups need to prioritize a strong product-market fit first, but be mindful of the opportunity cost of not growing quickly enough. 

Startups need to do some due diligence to find the right balance, including:

- Identifying key performance indicators that define product-market fit
- Testing the product-market fit early on in the development process
- Refining the target market to ensure better product-market fit
- Being flexible and willing to adjust the approach based on market feedback

As the startup grows, it’ll become easier to identify the right balance between product-market fit and scale. Early-stage startups, however, would benefit from a product-market fit-first approach before trying to scale too fast.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to whether your startup should focus on product-market fit or scale first. It’s crucial to find the right balance and prioritize your approach based on your business’s unique needs.

However, it’s important to keep in mind that without a strong product-market fit, trying to scale your startup can be difficult. All companies need to have a solid understanding of their target market and create a product that satisfies a strong market need before they begin to invest serious time and resources into scaling.

By focusing on both product-market fit and scale but prioritizing them in the right order, startups can set themselves up for long-term success.
